Data is from Inside Airbnb – http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html - using Listings and Reviews only

Start by building the database, using the provided script. From the command-line:

```
sqlite3 airbnb.sqlite3
.read import.sql
```

Each practice exercise is in its own file – `practice-*.sql` – and can be executed using the `.read` command within SQLite, e.g. `.read practice-1.sql`. Each exercise includes the question, and roughly the expected output.
